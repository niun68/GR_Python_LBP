Gender recognition based on LBP and SVM
This is a simple project for an exam of the master's degree in Computer Science. The idea is to elaborate male and female images separately and after mix and shuffle the result.
It's not perfect, but for thr purposes of the exam is enough. We use it as a comparision test with another script, also producted by us, whic instead uses CNNs as a modeler for the classifier.
We have used the dataset available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset?resource=download, without any commercial or business purpose.
For pratical reasons we have limited the number of the images to 1500 for each gender in  training, and 250 for each gender in validation.

Any suggestions for improvement are welcome.
